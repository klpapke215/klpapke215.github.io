I'm a clinical social worker in the state of Michigan, and I currently have two jobs. One is in a private practice, doing traditional psychotherapy with adolescents and adults. The other job is a school social worker with the virtual school programs in the state of MI. I'm fortunate enough to be married to a web developer, who is nothing short of a genius with computers. He's the one who researched programs for me and ended up recommending FlatIron School. So here I am!

So the reasons why I'm here revolve around three main factors. The first one relates to my job as a school social worker. It has required me to learn and adapt to new technologies over the years I've worked there. I use a platform similar to Skype to interact with my students, but despite various improvements, it's still not a very engaging platform for students. Hearing students' frustrations about the logistical problems of attending a virtual school was the first factor to plant a tech seed in my mind this year. 

The second motivating factor involves my own frustrations with obstacles to psychotherapy. Over my five years as a social worker, I've come up against numerous obstacles, but I think the biggest one is time. Clients see me for one hour/week, at most, depending on external factors like work schedules and insurance coverage. The rest of their time is spent trying to make internal changes in a life that may look the same externally, which is really hard to do sometimes. It takes a lot of work to manage a mental illness, and I don't know if one hour/week is sufficient. But when I look at how much time the average person spends on their smart phone/week, it's a different story. Spoiler alert: it's about 5 hours/day-that's enough time for five therapy sessions in just one day! This got me thinking more about a classic social work-ism: "meet the client where the client is at." If the client is on their phone, that's where their therapy could be as well! I love that there are so many great mental health apps out there already, but I have some ideas for improvements in the future. 

And the third factor that prompted me to begin this journey is my interest in academic research. I have had the opportunity to help out on multiple social and/or psychological research studies, and enjoyed those experiences. After grad school, I pursued clinical work in order to obtain my full clinical license, but the plan was always to return to research in some capacity once I had my license. I received my license two years ago, and am more than ready to return to research! But, through recent discussions with past mentors and current researchers, I've been told that I need to learn to code in order to be a strong candidate. 

Those are the three factors that motivated me to begin learning how to code.  As I've begun this course, I'm starting to see a possibility of a full career transition into tech. I have a tendency to be interested in too many things, though, which has been my greatest weakness! So I'm hoping that as I move along in this course, I'll be better able to gauge where I want to go with this skillset in my future career.
